			<h2>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</h2>
			<h3>History of Hogwarts</h3>
			<!-- add imaged of founders -->
			<p>Hogwarts was founded by two wizards and two witches around 990 A.D. Their names were Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Each of the founders represent aspects of the personality they wanted to bring out in the students of Hogwarts. Gryffindor represents bravery, Hufflepuff represents kindness, Ravenclaw represents wisdom, and Slytherin represents ambition. Hogwarts is separated into four houses, each named after a founder, and each house has its own common room, dormitories, and Head of House. Return to the <a href="#">top</a> of the page.</p>
