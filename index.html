			<h2>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</h2>
			<img src="images/hogwartscastlenight.jpg" alt="Building of Hogwarts on a starry night." height="288" width="477">
			<p>Magical children from all over the world dream of going to the prestegious school of Hogwarts. Hogwarts was founded by two wizards and two witches around 990 A.D. Their names were Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Each of the founders represent aspects of the personality they wanted to bring out in the students of Hogwarts. Gryffindor represents bravery, Hufflepuff represents kindness, Ravenclaw represents wisdom, and Slytherin represents ambition. Hogwarts is separated into four houses, each named after a founder, and each house has its own common room, dormitories, and Head of House.<br>Return to the <a href="#">top</a> of the page.</p>

			<h2>Diagon Alley and Knockturn Alley</h2>
			<h3>Diagon Alley</h3>
			<img src="images/diagonalley.jpg" alt="Stores in Diagon Alley, including Weasley's Wizard Wheezes and Olivanders." height="288" width="477">
			<p>Diagon Alley is a cobblestoned wizarding alley and shopping area located in London, England behind a pub called the Leaky Cauldron. The words &ldquo;Diagon&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alley&rdquo; when pronounced together, produce the word &ldquo;diagonally&rdquo; which is most probably the origin of the name &ldquo;Diagon Alley&rdquo;. Inside the alley are many various types of shops, and it is usually where  Hogwarts students buy all their supplies from. The alley is completely hidden from the Muggle world, even though it is right outside of its boundaries. It is very large in area and essentially the centre of wizarding London. Diagon Alley is accessible through the Leaky Cauldron, which is on Charing Cross Road in Muggle London, set next to a bookshop. As a result of numerous spells, Muggles who pass by the inn seem to be quite unaware of its existence.

			<h3>Knockturn Alley</h3>
			<img src="images/knockturn.gif" alt="A creepy skeleton found in a store in Knockturn Alley." height="288" width="477">
			<p>Knockturn Alley is a shopping area off Diagon Alley in London. The name &ldquo;Knockturn Alley&rdquo; is a play on &ldquo;nocturnally,&rdquo; which is related with the night and darkness, hinting at its dark nature. It is filled with numerous shops about the Dark Arts, such as Borgin and Burkes, which sells objects that have curious, strong and, more often than not, dark magical properties.  Unlike Diagon Alley, Knockturn Alley is not directly accessible from the Muggle world. Most people travel there through a passageway connected to Diagon Alley, or by apparation or Floo Powder.<br>Return to the <a href="#">top</a> of the page.</p>
